        Data mining is the process of searching through and analysing trends and patterns in large data sets. A frequent user of this application is your local supermarket. From patterns in which deals sell best, what the optimal placement of items on shelves is, how to improve customer retention, or even send specific deals and coupons to specific people with recent purchases, age and gender all in mind. A 2017 study shows the size of data sets which are mined (big data) for this information has doubled every 1.2 years as of 2014 which shows just how much of a growing industry it is (Iberdrola, 2023). This already massive growing industry specifically in supermarkets, currently and has been collecting data for years on individual people and its shoppers as a whole. This allow them to send deals and targeted advertisements but means they a lot about you as a shopper which is something this article aims to bring awareness too. This article aims to give a brief summary of how data mining is used in your local supermarket and bring light on how it already affects and store personal data about you. (Iberdrola, 2023)

        All modern supermarkets make use of data mining to increase profits. Data mining is the process of searching through and analysing large sets of data to find trends and patterns that would have otherwise gone unnoticed. These patterns can be used to optimize a supermarket’s (or any other shop) profit. In the US alone Walmart (a popular supermarket) collects (Figure 1:) 2.5 petabytes of data every hour (PROJECTPRO, 2023). For reference that’s 2,500,000GB (gigabytes) stored every hour for Walmart alone, where a decent computer may have around 500GB total showing just how large of an industry data mining is. If more evidence of its growth is needed look below at its market volume in figure 2. The purpose of this article is to make you aware of just how much supermarkets know about you and how much they collect about you every day. In the order of how data is collected until it is used to predict behaviour about individual shoppers I will discuss: How and what data is collected, the trends and patterns predicted, and how these apply to everyday customers.

        <b5 class="ex1">
        <br>
        To start, the large data sets that they collect is referred to as “Big data”. A good definition for Big data is “Any kind of data source that has at least 3 shared characteristics: Extremely large volumes of data, Extremely high velocity of data, Extremely wide variety of data” (Judith S. Hurwitz, 2013, pp. 48). This essentially means that large amounts of data, that’s being added upon frequently and is of many different types is considered big data, by which supermarket data sets are certainly big data. This is collected through many means. Some obvious ones include: club cards, purchase amount, and items purchased.

        <br>
        Club cards especially are important as they allow the supermarket to get lots of personal information about you as a person. For example if it registers that you only shop on weekends and only buy enough food for one person they can infer that you likley work during the week and live alone (since you don’t have time to shop during the week and don’t buy enough food to feed more than one person). On a larger scale by combining data from all their shoppers they can make a model of the demographic of their customers and make changes to accomadate this. For example if 85% of customers only shop on weekends then they can hire less people to work during the week, stock up less during the week and more during the weekend. This reduces the amount of food that must be thrown out and money spent on staff, saving money.

        Many of the trends and patterns discovered through data mining are either not published publicly or are difficult to find. This can be due to them having taken many resources from that supermarket company and publishing them publicly would give competitors free information. It can be also be due to that many trends depend on an individual supermarket location which can differ. A popular myth was spotted for a drug store called Osco Drug which found that fathers buying diapers would buy beer along with it 33% of the time (Can Contempory Analysis, 2020), however while this turned out to be false an analysis was done with data mining on Osco Drug. After removing 5000 lower selling products from stock found in a survey that people thought they had increased the number of items sold. This was because shoppers could find what they wanted easier and so sales increased.

        A process called CRM (Customer Relationship Management) aims to increase customer loyalty, gather customer data and predict customer habits for future shops (Bhattacharyya, 2022). This process works by gathering data about individual people who shop at a supermarket in an attempt to increase profits. This data of course is data mined and used to provide targeted ads, special deals, coupons, recommendations, and more for specific people. This can increase profits by up to 40-50% for a supermarket or retail store if executed correctly (Bhattacharyya, 2022). In practice the means that if an average shopper were to frequently buy fish pie for example, they may receive deals after some time for either fish pie or other item that trends from data mining have shown others who also buy fish pie frequently buy.

        Tesco’s club card is an excellent example of how data mining and data collection is applied at an individual level. Club cards as explained before store information about its holder for Tesco and allow very specific deals and advertisements. According to (Thomas H. Davenport, 2011) Tesco started sending out deals when fathers first bought baby wipes so they  “are mailed coupons not only for baby wipes and toys but also for beer”. This is because they buy more beer since they spend less time at the pub. A funny example of trends found by data mining.

        This is one of the most well known stories of data mining in supermarkets (Hill, 2012). In 2012 the store Target was able to predict a girl was pregnant before her father knew (Hill, 2012). What had happened was Target, like many other supermarkets keeps a record of customer data through their card details (their method of keeping data similar to a club card). Using their trends from data mining they saw that the girl was buying far more unscented lotion and cotton balls then previously which led the Target computers to believe she was pregnant (Hill, 2012). This then led them to send out booklets and discounts for products she may look to buy according to their data which was found by her father and later complained and learnt the truth from her. This shows the power of data mining and how much it can predict about people.
